## About SHACL
The [Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL)](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standard language for describing Resource Description Framework (RDF) graphs.
Among others, it includes features to express conditions that constrain the number of values that a property may have, the type of such values, numeric ranges, string matching patterns, and logical combinations of such constraints.
SHACL also includes an extension mechanism to express more complex conditions in languages such as SPARQL and JavaScript. 

## About this page
This page is a quick introduction of using SHACL with OpenStreetMap data.
Uses [Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) as an example, but could be expressed in other serializations, such as [JSON-LD](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/).
